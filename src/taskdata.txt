6068, How do you change the CLASSPATH of a Java process from within the Java process? hr Before you ask me "Why would you want to do that?" I'll explain it shortly. blockquote When you have a Clojure REPL running it is common to need more jars in your CLASSPATH to load a a href="http://clojure.org" rel="noreferrer" Clojure a source file and I'd like to do it without having to restart Clojure itself which is not really an option when using it on Slime on Emacs . blockquote That's the reason but I don't want this question tagged as some-weird-language some-weird-editor and be disregarded by the majority of Java developers that may have the answer.

I never made a web app from scratch in Java. If I have to do it with Python Ruby I know where to go Django or Rails but if I want to make a web application in Clojure not because I'm forced to live in a Java world but because I like the language and I want to give it a try what libraries and frameworks should I use?

12870, This is a bleeding-edge feature that I'm currently skewered upon and quickly bleeding out. I want to annotate a subquery-aggregate onto an existing queryset. Doing this before 1.11 either meant custom SQL or hammering the database. a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/models/expressions/#using-aggregates-within-a-subquery-expression" rel="noreferrer" Here's the documentation for this a and the example from it: pre code from django.db.models import OuterRef Subquery Sum comments = Comment.objects.filter post=OuterRef 'pk' .values 'post' total_comments = comments.annotate total=Sum 'length' .values 'total' Post.objects.filter length__gt=Subquery total_comments code pre They're em annotating em on the aggregate which seems weird to me but whatever. I'm struggling with this so I'm boiling it right back to the simplest real-world example I have data for. I have code Carpark code s which contain many code Space code s. Use code Bookâ†’Author code if that makes you happier but â€”for nowâ€?I just want to annotate on a count of the related model using code Subquery code *. pre code spaces = Space.objects.filter carpark=OuterRef 'pk' .values 'carpark' count_spaces = spaces.annotate c=Count '*' .values 'c' Carpark.objects.annotate space_count=Subquery count_spaces code pre This gives me a lovely code ProgrammingError: more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression code and in my head this error makes perfect sense. The subquery is returning a list of spaces with the annotated-on total. The example suggested that some sort of magic would happen and I'd end up with a number I could use. But that's not happening here? How do I annotate on aggregate Subquery data? h2 Hmm something's being added to my query's SQL... h2 I built a new Carpark/Space model and it worked. So the next step is working out what's poisoning my SQL. On Laurent's advice I took a look at the SQL and tried to make it more like the version they posted in their answer. And this is where I found the real problem: pre code SELECT "bookings_carpark".* SELECT COUNT U0."id" AS "c" FROM "bookings_space" U0 WHERE U0."carpark_id" = "bookings_carpark"."id" GROUP BY U0."carpark_id" strong U0."space" strong AS "space_count" FROM "bookings_carpark" code pre I've highlighted it but it's that subquery's code GROUP BY ... U0."space" code . It's retuning both for some reason. Investigations continue. Edit 2: Okay just looking at the subquery SQL I can see that second group by coming through â˜? pre code In [12]: print Space.objects_standard.filter .values 'carpark' .annotate c=Count '*' .values 'c' .query SELECT COUNT * AS "c" FROM "bookings_space" GROUP BY "bookings_space"."carpark_id" "bookings_space"."space" ORDER BY "bookings_space"."carpark_id" ASC "bookings_space"."space" ASC code pre strong Edit 3 strong : Okay! Both these models have sort orders. These are being carried through to the subquery. It's these orders that are bloating out my query and breaking it. I guess this might be a bug in Django but short of removing the Meta-order_by on both these models strong is there any way I can em unsort em a query at querytime? strong hr sub * strong I know I could just annotate a Count for this example strong . My real purpose for using this is a much more complex filter-count but I can't even get this working. sub

I've seen some fairly scary-looking extra-select queries but my simple mind is telling me I might be better off just iterating numbers starting from an arbitrary start year/month and counting up until I reach the current month throwing out simple queries filtering for that month. More database work - less developer stress! What makes most sense to you? Is there a nice way I can pull back a quick table of data? Or is my dirty method probably the best idea? I'm using Django 1.3. Not sure if they've added a nicer way to code GROUP_BY code recently.

It only wants a dictionary containing keys code ['key1' 'key2' 'key99'] code and if it gets another key eg code 'key3' code it explodes in a nasty mess.

I must have done this a dozen times in a dozen languages over the years but Python usually has a simple answer to everything so I thought I'd ask here before busting out some nauseatingly simple yet verbose mathematics. Mr Fooz raises a good point. I'm dealing with "listings" a bit like ebay listings where each one has a duration. I'm trying to find the time left by doing code when_added + duration - now code Am I right in saying that wouldn't account for DST? If not what's the simplest way to add/subtract an hour?

This is going through Django's ORM so I can't use SQL to do the conversion on insert. 
12870, I'm deploying a replacement site for a client but they don't want all their old pages to end in 404s. Keeping the old URL structure wasn't possible because it was hideous. So I'm writing a 404 handler that should look for an old page being requested and do a permanent redirect to the new page. Problem is I need a list of all the old page URLs. I could do this manually but I'd be interested if there are any apps that would provide me a list of relative eg: /page/path not http:/.../page/path URLs just given the home page. Like a spider but one that doesn't care about the content other than to find deeper pages.

I have seen em so em many purported "standards" for the JSON content type: pre code application/json application/x-javascript text/javascript text/x-javascript text/x-json code pre But which one is correct or best?

12870, I'm trying to ensure a script remains running on a development server. It collates stats and provides a web service so it's supposed to persist yet a few times a day it dies off for unknown reasons. When we notice we just launch it again but it's a pain in the rear and some users don't have permission or the knowhow to launch it up. The programmer in me wants to spend a few hours getting to the bottom of the problem but the busy person in me thinks there must be an easy way to detect if an app is not running and launch it again. I know I em could em cron-script ps through grep: pre code ps -A | grep appname code pre But again that's another hour of my life wasted on doing something that must already exist... Is there not a pre-made app that I can pass an executable optionally with arguments and that will keep a process running indefinitely? In case it makes any difference it's Ubuntu. 
12870, I've just done my first little webapp in django and I love it. I'm about to start on converting an old production PHP site into django and as part its template there is a navigation bar. In PHP I check each nav option's URL against the current URL in the template code and apply a CSS class if they line up. It's horrendously messy. Is there something better for django or a good way of handling the code in the template? To start how would I go about getting the current URL? 
12870, I have made an online gallery using Python and Django. I've just started to add editing functionality starting with a rotation. I use sorl.thumbnail to auto-generate thumbnails on demand. When I edit the original file I need to clean up all the thumbnails so new ones are generated. There are three or four of them per image I have different ones for different occasions . I em could em hard-code in the file-varients... But that's messy and if I change the way I do things I'll need to revisit the code. Ideally I'd like to do a regex-delete. In regex terms all my originals are named like so: pre code ^ ?P photo_id \d+ \.jpg$ code pre So I want to delete: pre code ^ ?P photo_id \d+ [^\d].*jpg$ code pre Where I replace code photo_id code with the ID I want to clean. 
12870, I'm writing a simple real-estate listing app in Django. Each property needs to have a variable number of images. Images need to have an editable order. And I need to make the admin user-proof. So that said what are my options? ol Is there a ImageList field that I don't know about? Is there an app like code django.contrib.comments code that does the job for me? If I have to write it myself how would I go about making the admin-side decent? I'm imagining something a lot slicker than what ImageField provides with some drag'n'drop for re-ordering. But I'm a complete clutz at writing admin pages = ol

95592, In HTML5 I know that code nav code can be used either inside or outside the page's masthead code header code element. For websites having both secondary and main navigation it seems common to include the secondary navigation as a code nav code element inside the masthead code header code element with the main navigation as a code nav code element outside the masthead code header code element. However if the website lacks secondary navigation it appears common to include the main navigation in a code nav code element within the masthead code header code element. If I follow these examples my content structure will be based on the inclusion or exclusion of secondary navigation. This introduces a coupling between the content and the style that feels unnecessary and unnatural. Is there a better way so that I'm not moving the main navigation from inside to outside the masthead code header code element based on the inclusion or exclusion of secondary navigation? h2 Main and Secondary Navigation Example h2 pre code header nav !-- Secondary Navigation inside header -- ul li /li /ul /nav h1 Website Title /h1 /header nav !-- Main Navigation outside header -- ul li /li /ul /nav code pre a href="http://onlinedegrees.org" OnlineDegrees.org a is an example site that follows the above pattern. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jolBc.png" alt="enter image description here" h2 Main Only Navigation Example h2 pre code header h1 Website Title /h1 nav !-- Main Navigation inside header -- ul li /li /ul /nav /header code pre a href="http://keyzo.co.uk/" Keyzo.co.uk a is an example site that follows the above pattern. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0JD0t.png" alt="enter image description here" h2 Excerpts from em Introducing HTML5 em â€”Â Added on 02-Feb-11 7:38 AM h2 a href="http://amzn.com/0321687299" em Introducing HTML5 em a by Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp has this to say about the subject: blockquote The header can also contain navigation. This can be very useful for site-wide navigation especially on template-driven sites where the whole of the code header code element could come from a template file. Of course it's not required that the code nav code be in the code header code .

364969, I'm currently using a simple $_FILES upload script to upload pictures from my iPhone app to server. The image sizes however are large and I'd like to resize them before sending the image to the server. The downside of this however is that the resize function converts them to "blob" images which as I understand it is a way of storing the image in the database . I'd prefer to save the files directly to the filesystem. How would I go about converting a blob back into a $_FILE or finding a script that saves blob images to disc?? Thank you! 
364969, Anyone have any suggestions? Running Debian and looking for a good alternative.
